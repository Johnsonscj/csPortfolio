<p> This allowed me to use HTML and CSS together. I thought it was helpful to get a taste of different programming languages. It was also a way to display what I am passionate in. </p>

<details><summary><strong> Java Lighting</strong></summary>
 
* Lightning Java [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/lightning2/)
<p>I used basic common java in this project. It was a good project to start with after the long summer. I also was able to use some HTML on the website where I created the lightning.</p>

<details><summary><strong> Dice</strong></summary>
 
* Dice [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/dice3/index.html)
 
<p>I was able to use object oriented programming to create many different dice. I also involved different booleans into my program and made different levels. This program shows how powerful object oriented programming is.

  <details><summary><strong> Starfield</strong></summary>
 
* Star Field[ here ](https://johnsonscj.github.io/starfield5/)
<p>This was my most complex program. I incorporated interface and inheritance in my code. This program entailed a lot of trial and error because it involved many things I have not used in programming yet. For example, I was able to use maps in this program which I have never used before.

<p>1. Done 2. The first thing that I pride myself in my coding is the initial process. I enjoy looking at the big picture of my program. I like to think out in my head what I want to do. I am also pretty creative, and this allows me to think of good ideas for my projects. The second thing that I pride myself in coding is how I resolve my errors. I am able to discuss with many people around me, or I rewrite my code because I think there is a lot of power in rewriting code.            3.My accomplishment was being able to use HTML and CSS. At first, I was nervous to try a different programming language because I felt so comfortable with java. However, I knew trying a new language would be a wise decision. I do not love HTML, but I did learn a lot about HTML. This was a huge accomplishment because I was able to have an open mind and try something new.  Ex.( .overlay {
  position: absolute;
    top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-color: brown;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 0;
  height: 100%;
  transition: .5s ease;
}

```Java
\\moves the particles
 void move1() {
        if(y1<=ran4 ){
      count++;
        for(int i =1; i<p.length/2; i++){
          if(count < 2){
          p[i].setX(x1);
          p[i].setY(ran4);
          }
          p[i].move();
          p[i].show();
          
          finish=true;
         
        }     
        }else{
