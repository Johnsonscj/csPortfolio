<p> This allowed me to use HTML and CSS together. I thought it was helpful to get a taste of different programming languages. It was also a way to display what I am passionate in. </p>

<details><summary><strong> Java Lighting</strong></summary>
 
* Lightning Java [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/lightning2/)
<p>I used basic common java in this project. It was a good project to start with after the long summer. I also was able to use some HTML on the website where I created the lightning.</p>

<details><summary><strong> Dice</strong></summary>
 
* Dice [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/dice3/index.html)
 
<p>I was able to use object oriented programming to create many different dice. I also involved different booleans into my program and made different levels. This program shows how powerful object oriented programming is.

  <details><summary><strong> Starfield</strong></summary>
 
* Star Field[ here ](https://johnsonscj.github.io/starfield5/)
<p>This was my most complex program. I incorporated interface and inheritance in my code. This program entailed a lot of trial and error because it involved many things I have not used in programming yet. For example, I was able to use maps in this program which I have never used before.

 <p> 1. Done </p>
 <p>2. The first thing that I pride myself in my coding is the initial process. I enjoy looking at the big picture of my program. I like to think out in my head what I want to do. I am also pretty creative, and this allows me to think of good ideas for my projects. The second thing that I pride myself in coding is how I resolve my errors. I am able to discuss with many people around me, or I rewrite my code because I think there is a lot of power in rewriting code. </p>           
 <p>3.My accomplishment was being able to use HTML and CSS. At first, I was nervous to try a different programming language because I felt so comfortable with java. However, I knew trying a new language would be a wise decision. I do not love HTML, but I did learn a lot about HTML. This was a huge accomplishment because I was able to have an open mind and try something new.  Ex.
 
 
 .overlay {
  position: absolute;
    top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background-color: brown;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 0;
  height: 100%;
  transition: .5s ease;
}

 4.My highest hurdle this trimester was being able to create fireworks in my project StarField. I struggled a few days in creating this in my project. I realized most of my code was pretty bad, so I deleted all of it. I thought about what I wanted to do big picture. This was a huge success because I was able to be creative and how I was going to do this. Although I ended up needing help from the people around me, it was the highest hurdle because of the process I used to get over this problem.
 </p>
 
<p>5.I showed this through the layout of my portfolio.</p>
<p>
 6.I always tried to start out my projects on a piece of paper. I wanted to get down the big picture of my goal in this project. The reason why I do this is because I want to have direction within my code. I want to know where I am going within my code.  My next step in my process was to become more specific in my projects. I would translate what I thought of big picture into smaller details. There were many difficulties I faced within my coded that I resolved in different ways. If it was a simple problem I could normally figure out the problem. However, if it was a large problem I would try to rewrite the part that was wrong because I could try to figure out the solution a different way. I prefer to collaborate in the process of making my program because sometimes others can easily see what you're doing wrong. I have found that I would become blind to the problems in my own code. Also, I have to learn from others that know more than me. Overall, I prefer to be collaborative in my coding process.

```Java
\\moves the particles
 void move1() {
        if(y1<=ran4 ){
      count++;
        for(int i =1; i<p.length/2; i++){
          if(count < 2){
          p[i].setX(x1);
          p[i].setY(ran4);
          }
          p[i].move();
          p[i].show();
          
          finish=true;
         
        }
