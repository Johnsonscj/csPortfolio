<p> This allowed me to use HTML and CSS together. I thought it was helpful to get a taste of different programming languages. It was also a way to display what I am passionate in. </p>

<details><summary><strong> Java Lighting</strong></summary>
 
* Lightning Java [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/lightning2/)
<p>I used basic common java in this project. It was a good project to start with after the long summer. I also was able to use some HTML on the website where I created the lightning.</p>

<details><summary><strong> Dice</strong></summary>
 
* Dice [here](https://johnsonscj.github.io/dice3/index.html)
 
<p>I was able to use object oriented programming to create many different dice. I also involved different booleans into my program and made different levels. This program shows how powerful object oriented programming is.

  <details><summary><strong> Starfield</strong></summary>
 
* Star Field[ here ](https://johnsonscj.github.io/starfield5/)
<p>This was my most complex program. I incorporated interface and inheritance in my code. This program entailed a lot of trial and error because it involved many things I have not used in programming yet. For example, I was able to use maps in this program which I have never used before.

      count++;
        for(int i =1; i<p.length/2; i++){
          if(count < 2){
          p[i].setX(x1);
          p[i].setY(ran4);
          }
          p[i].move();
